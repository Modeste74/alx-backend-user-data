<h1>0x00. Personal data</h1>
<h2>Back-end Authentification</h2>
<p>PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information. It's any information that can be used to identify a specific person. This includes things like your name, address, phone number, email, social security number, driver's license number, or even some personal details like your date of birth or medical information. Basically, it's any data that could be used on its own or combined with other information to figure out who you are. Protecting PII is important to keep your personal information safe and prevent it from being misused or accessed by people who shouldn't have it.</p>
<p>On this repo will be tackling tasks on PIIs</p>
